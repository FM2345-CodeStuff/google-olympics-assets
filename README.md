# google-olympics-assets
I was bored and decided to archive an Google Olympics page, then i wanted to get the assets cuz why not, then i made an scratch program that sorts a list of file direction by their file extension, and that's how i did.

# What this repository contains
- List (sorted by program) *(july 31.txt)*
- Sort program *(sorter.sb3)*
- A webpage containing  the links *(https://fm2345-codestuff.github.io/google-olympics-assets/)*

If the files get deleted for whatever reason, i'll archive them.
